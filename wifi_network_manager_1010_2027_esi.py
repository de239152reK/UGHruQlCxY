WiFi Network Manager
=================

A Python script to manage WiFi networks using numpy and subprocess module.

The script provides functionality to scan available WiFi networks and connect to a specified network.

Attributes:
    None

Methods:
    scan_networks(): Scans available WiFi networks and returns a list of available networks.
# 改进用户体验
    connect_to_network(ssid, password): Connects to a specified WiFi network with the given password.
# 改进用户体验

Example:
    >>> wifi_manager = WiFiNetworkManager()
    >>> networks = wifi_manager.scan_networks()
    >>> wifi_manager.connect_to_network(networks[0], 'your_password')
# NOTE: 重要实现细节

Note:
# TODO: 优化性能
    The script uses the 'nmcli' command-line tool to interact with the network manager.
    Ensure that 'nmcli' is installed and available on your system.
